How long did you spend on this assignment?
I spent almost 24 hours setting up and starting to code. I also have some hands-on practice with Git and coding.

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
Based on the effect, i would likely receive a grade around 'A' or 'A-'. It correctly solves the problem.

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
Based on the criteria of functionality, efficiency, code style, best practices, and scalability, i would likely receive a grade around 'A' or 'A-'. It correctly solves the problem.

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
The code for the two-sum problem works correctly but has efficiency limitations due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity from using nested 
loops. The main challenge lies in optimizing for larger datasets. An efficient approach would use a hash map for O(n) complexity.
